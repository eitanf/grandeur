// MoveNotifier is a singleton that lets interested observers (e.g., players)
// register to receive notifications for any board changes. They register
// a callback function that gets the new state of the Board, and if a move was
// just made, the player who made it and the move.
// There are two special cases when NULL_MOVE is passed: At the beginning of the
// game, before any moves were made, and at the end of a game, with the winning
// player passed as the moving player's pid (or an index too large if stalemate)
