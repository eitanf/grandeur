// An implementation of a Mini-Max algorithm player.
// The player is initialized with an evaluator function that scores each possible
// move for a given board state. At depth 1, this is identical to the greedy player--
// it just picks the highest-scoring move. At depth N, it picks the moves that produces
// the highest score sum for the next N moves, where the opponent's highest score in
// each subsequent move is deducted from the current move's score.
